Getting hug setup for local development
=========
The first step when contributing to any project is getting it setup on your local machine, hug aims to make this as simple as possible.

Account Requirements:
- A valid GitHub account (https://github.com/join)

Base System Requirements:
- Python3.3+
- Python3-venv (included w/ most Python3 installations but some Ubuntu systems require that it be installed separately)
- bash or a bash compatible shell (should be auto-installed on Linux / Mac)
- autoenv - https://github.com/kennethreitz/autoenv (optional)

Once you have verified that you system matches the base requirements you can start get the project working by following these steps:

1. Fork the project on GitHub (https://github.com/timothycrosley/hug/fork).
2. Clone your fork to your local file system:
    `git clone https://github.com/$GITHUB_ACCOUNT/hug.git`
3. `cd hug`
    - If you have autoenv set-up correctly simply press Y and then wait for the environment to be setup for you.
    - If you don't have autoenv set-up run `source .env` to setup the local environment. You will need to run this script everytime you want to work on the project - though it will not cause the entire setup process to re-occur.
4. run `test` to verify your everything is setup correctly, if the tests all pass you have succesfully setup hug for local development! If not you can ask for help diagnosing the error here: https://gitter.im/timothycrosley/hug.
